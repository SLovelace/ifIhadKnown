  <li><a href="http://www.dcottawa.on.ca/"> Distress centre Ottawa</a>: <italic>The distress center hotline was the number I called to get some advice on how what next steps should be taken to figure out what next steps should be taken to make sure that my parents were safe and figure out how to deal with my brother in his current, very angry and potentially violent or damaging state. The team was very helpful, informed and gave me exactly what I needed to be able to deal with the current situation and begin planning for what happens after. My contact was connie and the number I can reach her on is 613-241-3925.</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Other helpful information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the problem continues and safety is a factor, there is a mobile crisi team through the distress center that can be sent over to mitigate conflict and help manage the situation</li>
  <li>The best solution is to get brother to his doctor (dr. swinson) ASAP and get him into the hospital. To do this, DR. swinson will fill in a form 1 which identifies brother as a threat to himself or others</li>
  <li>Another solution is getting a form 2 filled out and reviewed by a justice of the peace. this is the option when DR. swinson can't help. The Distress center can help with this (call connie to sort it out).<li>
  <li>The distress center is the right place to call</li>

<h2>If I had known then what I know now...</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I would have suggested in february that brother head to the doctors every 2 weeks for a checkin</li>
  <li>I would have discussed his mention of suicide with my parents at the time he sent me the text</li>
  <li>I would have had discussions with him in December about his mental health management and talked about it with my parents including regular visits to the doctor, sleep scheduling, counsiling and diet. this conversation would have included full family management, not just brother's</li>
  <li>I would have talked to my borther about how to stop this from getting crazy before it did.</li>
