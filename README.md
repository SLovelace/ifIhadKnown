# ifIhadKnown
An information repository for resources on mental health and mental health care management.

Over time, it might develop into a guide for readers who are new to the world of having a person close struggle with issues in mental health and for those who are experienced with the problems a loved one struggles with, but are looking for new opportunities to solve problems differently. 

Alternately, it might become something else.

Whatever it is meant to be, today it is a place to record and collect information and to think.
